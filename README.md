# Lazy-CL
Python script for the lazy that automatically manages Aerodrome CL deposits so that you can stop clicking on Aerodrome. Instadumps AERO. Uses Telegram for user communication. Replace contract addresses to whatever pool and tokens you want. Replace settings and variables to whatever you want. Can probably be mass produced for multiple pools using Ape's Silverback. Probably works on Velo and other forks and chains.

### To do
- Automatically fund gas: sell 10-20 USDC or AERO for ETH when ETH balance drops below threshold
